# RPG Game: Fantasy Training Camp

## Game Lore
You are heroes of a foreign land, that arose from the ashes after the battle of the _Bowling Green Massacre_.
Now, you train daily against each other to combat the remaining extremists who have risen from the shadows since the new regime of the land. Flying daggers and torch on torch violence have been on the raise, and you must prepare.

## How to Play
You shall pick one of three heroes: Chad the archer, Bill the mage, and Dick the assassin. Once you have chosen a hero,  you will pick one of your fellow heroes as an opponent to play against per fighting round.

### Player Stats vs. Computer Stats
Each character you pick has a different attack, attack speed, and health. Each opponent you are pitted against as a different duration multiplier inferior to yours.

### Combat Mechanics
The opponent has a fixed attack loop. He will begin attacking as soon as you do. Your attacks are controlled by your mouse click, and only evoked once you click the target you want to attack. 

Each time you select your target, your attack will restart, so shoot wisely. Spamming multiple attacks in a roll is ineffective; your attack only registers if it travels its distance from your weapon to your target. You cannot deplete the enemy's health without going the full distance.

### Progression
Each time you or the opponent losses health, the other will win the round, the scores will be tallied on top of the screen, and the next round will start. If the current round is the last round, the game is over.

## Future Enhancements
* __Restart Game__ currently, you need to refresh the page to start a brand new game once all the rounds have completed. A reset button will be added in a future version.
* __Jump Mechanic__: just as you now select the enemy to attack, soon it will be possible to select yourself to jump or evade an attack.
* __Joey the Tank__: we are excited to inform you that a new hero will soon be added to the ranks with a brand new mechanic; instead of shooting the target to inflict damage, you will use a shield to deflect inflicted damage back to the opponent.

* __User interface__: We know the current UI looks a little slate. We will be adding visual enhancements to the character selection and _Round_ status messages.
